# Learning to Drive with Genetic Evolution
 
This repository attempts to solve the task of driving with genetic evolution.

Uses a small neural network and random mutations with natural selection to obtain an optimum results.

Hints of desired behaviour are seen right from generation 1. Proper convergence is reached around generation 15.
The small nature of the neural network, and the data deficiency allows the network to not overfit to a particular type of map.

### ToDo
[] Add obstacles and experiment by inputting the history of distances into neural network to optimize behaviour.
